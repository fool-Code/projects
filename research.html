    <h3>Electron Microscopy</h3>
    <p>I enjoy working with electron microscopy because it lets us look very closely at our 
      materials. We can not only take detailed images, but also learn about their structure 
      and composition. This helps us understand why they behave in certain ways and how 
      we can improve them.

        <div class="caption">
          These SEM images were taken with a Superscan SSX-550 and were the first pictures I made 
          of my samples. We can see how the morphology changes as the cryomilling time increases. 
          Because of the limits of the instrument, I wasn’t able to get sharper focus or higher 
          magnification at that stage.

            I took this image using a Thermo Fisher SCIOS with the SE detector, in high-resolution 
            conditions with a 3 mm working distance and 10 kV. These images have better resolution 
            and magnification compared with the Superscan. We can also see that the holes and surface 
            features change as the cryomilling time increases.

    <h3>Python applied to materials science</h3>
    <p>
      In materials science, we often rely on paid software to analyse and plot data, and this can
      create a gap for researchers who need more flexible tools. I believe Python can fill much of
      this space. With its open-source libraries and machine learning models, we can work on tasks
      such as image processing, noise reduction, prediction, and many other applications. It gives
      us more freedom to explore our data and develop our own methods.
