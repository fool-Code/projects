    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="card section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Project Overview</h2>

        <p class="text-justify">
            This project aims to address one of the major challenges in electron microscopy (EM):
            obtaining high-quality, noise-free images during data acquisition. Many factors can
            degrade an EM image — poor sample preparation, environmental drift, incorrect
            astigmatism alignment, or inaccurate Z-height adjustments. Beam energy can also damage
            delicate samples or introduce artefacts into the image.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top: 15px;">
            These issues are familiar to anyone who has spent time at the microscope. When focusing
            on fine features, drift or astigmatism can ruin an otherwise promising dataset and
            require constant manual correction. With recent advances in AI-based image processing,
            there is now an opportunity to improve EM images after acquisition — not with
            unrealistic “CSI-style enhancement,” but with meaningful denoising and feature
            restoration.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top: 15px;">
            While AI denoising is common in consumer imaging, its application in materials
            characterisation is still emerging, creating an exciting research space.

    <!-- CURRENT MODELS -->
    <section class="card section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Small Review of Current Models</h2>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Several modern machine-learning approaches are being tested in EM imaging, including
            diffusion models, vision transformers, and hybrid convolution–transformer networks.
            Diffusion-based models such as
            <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49125-z" target="_blank">EMDiffuse (Lu et al., 2024)</a>
            demonstrate strong performance in restoring ultrastructural detail.
            Broader surveys of DDPM/DDIM approaches show effectiveness in denoising, segmentation,
            classification, and super-resolution for microscopic images
            (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12309395/" target="_blank">Liu et al., 2025</a>).
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top: 15px;">
            Transformers and hybrid networks are becoming increasingly common. For example, a
            <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-68918-2" target="_blank">CNN-Transformer model (Rehman et al., 2024)</a>
            was developed specifically for fluorescence microscopy denoising, offering stronger
            generalisation than traditional CNNs. Other studies investigate
            <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1566253523003597" target="_blank">cross-transformers (Tian et al., 2024)</a>,
            combining residual, parallel, and serial blocks to target complex noise structures.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top: 15px;">
            Despite promising progress, challenges remain. High-quality paired datasets of noisy and
            clean EM images are difficult to obtain. EM noise patterns — drift, astigmatism, beam
            damage — differ significantly from natural images. High-resolution data also creates
            computational constraints. Finally, models trained on specific microscopes or samples
            may not generalise without careful fine-tuning.

    <!-- POSSIBLE OUTCOMES -->

        <h2 class="section-title">Possible Outcomes</h2>

        <p class="text-justify">
            By the end of this project, I aim to better understand how AI models can mitigate drift,
            noise, and focus-related artefacts in EM imaging. Even modest improvements could reduce
            the time spent fine-tuning microscope settings and help preserve important physical
            details during acquisition.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top: 15px;">
            The project may also reveal limitations of current models when applied to EM datasets —
            helping identify which noise patterns are still difficult to handle and what types of
            training data may be needed in the future.
